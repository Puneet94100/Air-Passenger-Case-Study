# Title of Project

## Air Passenger Forecasting Project
## Introduction
This project is aimed at forecasting the number of air passengers in the future using time series analysis. The project uses two popular time series forecasting models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMAX (Seasonal ARIMA) as well as Facebook's Prophet model. The data used in the project consists of monthly passenger numbers for a period of several years.



## Data 
The data used in this project consists of monthly passenger numbers for a period of several years. The data is provided in a CSV file and includes the following columns:

- Month: The date of the observation in the format YYYY-MM.
- Passengers: The number of passengers in thousands.
The data is representative of a real-world scenario and contains seasonal patterns, trends, and fluctuations that are typical in air passenger numbers. The goal of the project is to use time series analysis and machine learning models to forecast the number of air passengers in the future.

The data set is downloaded from kaggle.

## Prerequisites
The following packages and libraries are required to run this project:

Python 3.x
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Statsmodels
FBProphet





## Result

The results of the air passenger forecasting project show that SARIMAX and Prophet  are able to accurately predict the number of air passengers in the future, but ARIMA is not giving the good prediction. The Prophet model provides the best results in terms of accuracy and robustness, and it is  giving faster pediction and easy-to-use.
## Conclusion

The air passenger forecasting project demonstrates the potential of time series analysis and machine learning in predicting the future. This project can be further improved by incorporating additional data sources, such as weather data or economic indicators, to provide a more complete picture of the factors that influence air passenger numbers.
